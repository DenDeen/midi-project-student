# MIDI Project

This repository contains all information regarding the MIDI project.
This includes

* Some starter code
* Tests
* Documentation
* Configuration settings

## How To Get Started

1. Start by going through the setup instructions (linked to below).
   Make sure to go through every step.
   If you have a problem due to not following these instructions correctly, the only help from me you will get is a link to this page.
2. Skim through the background information (link below) to get an idea of what is available.
   While certainly allowed, it is of little use to read this information thoroughly now.
   By the time you will need it, you will have forgotten most of it.
   The purpose of this background information is that you look it up whenever you need it, which is why you need to be aware of which topics are considered.
3. Start going through the Implementation Details documentation (link below) in order.
   Include the corresponding tests, create the necessary files and write code.
   Only proceed to the next step when everything compiles and all tests pass.
