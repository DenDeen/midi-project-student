= `EventMulticaster`

We turn our attention to `EventMulticaster`.
This class is itself an `EventReceiver`.
Its purpose is to forward all the events it receives to other ``EventReceiver``s.

The constructor accepts a vector of `std::shared_ptr<EventReceiver>`s.
At each event X, it iterates over the vector and calls each ``EventReceiver``'s corresponding X member function.

[NOTE]
====
Visual Studio 2017 might indicate errors regarding a missing `check_finished` member function in this test file.
You can ignore them, it'll compile and run just fine.

This bug seems to have been fixed in Visual Studio 2019.
