= `CHUNK_HEADER`

As explained in the link:../../../background-information/midi.asciidoc#chunks[MIDI background information], each chunk describes itself in its header.

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Define the struct `CHUNK_HEADER` to store chunk header data.

Keep it simple: if the documentation says the header contains two 32-bit unsigned ``int``s, you only need to create a `struct` with two `uint32_t` fields.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Rely on the `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` types to make sure your data types have the correct size.
These are defined in the `cstdint` library header file.
