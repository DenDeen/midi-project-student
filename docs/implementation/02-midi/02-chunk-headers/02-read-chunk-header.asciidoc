= `read_chunk_header`

Now that we have defined our `CHUNK_HEADER`, we can write a function to read it from a file.
Usage would be as follows:

[source,c++]
----
midi::CHUNK_HEADER header;
midi::read_chunk_header(ss, &header);
----

[NOTE,caption={task-caption}]
====
Write a function `read_chunk_header`.
Take a look at the tests to determine its parameters and return type.
====

IMPORTANT: Rely on previously defined `io` functionality to implement this function.
